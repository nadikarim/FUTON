# FUTON
> From Us To Nature

Futon is an application to classify endangered species in Indonesia. This application was made to make people easily recognized endangered species in Indonesia so that they will not miss clasify them and increase their awareness about endangered species around us.

Based on our research, Indonesian people have slightly low awareness about endangered species in Indonesia, and risking its species' existence. Based on that problem, we want to make an application and we call it FUTON, in hope that we can increase Indonesian people awareness about endangered species around us and help conservation areas to maintain their existence.
