## Dataset and Data Preparation

The dataset we use for this model is a combined dataset of our own collective dataset, [Indonesian Endangered Species 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyanurfadhila/indonesian-endangered-animal), and [Indonesian Endangered Species 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyanurfadhila/indonesia-endangered-animal2). You can download the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1C2ML8iLXsRkCa-wz-grqHjMMsJzLJAf3). This dataset contains 5107 images of 58 kinds of endangered species in Indonesia, and one category for non-endangered species in Indonesia.

We split the dataset using [split-folders](https://pypi.org/project/split-folders/) library in Python into three directories Training, Validation, Testing with Ratio (0.8, 0.1, 0.1). Then, we use image augmentation to rescale the dataset by 1/255 and resize it to 224x224, we think this number is not too big and not too small to affect loss and the performance of our CNN.

Here are some of the dataset and their labels we use on this model.
