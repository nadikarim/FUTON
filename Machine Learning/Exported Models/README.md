## Exported Models

Because of the [File Size Limitation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github) (can't upload files >50 MB) on Github, we only can upload two of four exported models.

You can download all exported models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jiE3twAwiocT-oB_dXqHVty28BP5IxuX?usp=sharing)
